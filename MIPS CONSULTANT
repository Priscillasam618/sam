Maximizing MIPS Performance with imagnumâ€™s Consulting and Reporting Services
What is MIPS Consulting and Reporting Services?

The Merit-based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) is a critical component of the Quality Payment Program (QPP), designed to incentivize clinicians for delivering high-quality care and improving patient outcomes. MIPS encompasses various performance categories, including Quality, Cost, Promoting Interoperability, and Improvement Activities, each contributing to a clinician's overall MIPS score and potential reimbursement adjustments.

At iMagnum, we offer comprehensive MIPS Consulting and Reporting Services tailored to help clinicians navigate the complexities of MIPS participation, optimize performance, and maximize reimbursement potential.

Core Components of Our MIPS Consulting and Reporting Services:

1. **Quality Reporting:** We assist clinicians in selecting and reporting on appropriate quality measures to demonstrate the quality of care delivered to patients, ensuring compliance with MIPS requirements and maximizing performance scores.

2. **Cost Reporting:** Our services include analyzing cost data derived from Medicare Part B claims to assess the cost of care provided by clinicians, helping identify opportunities for cost reduction and optimization.

3. **Promoting Interoperability (PI) Reporting:** We evaluate clinicians' engagement in patient care and electronic health information exchange using certified EHR technology, ensuring compliance with PI requirements and maximizing performance in this category.

4. **Improvement Activities:** We assess clinicians' involvement in activities aimed at enhancing clinical practice and patient engagement, guiding them in selecting and reporting on relevant improvement activities to optimize their MIPS performance.
